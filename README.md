## Purpose
This repository is intended to facilitate re-use of this regionally-resolved inventory of Hg emissions to air. 
Data include emissions (Mg/yr) for each of the years 2010-2015 at two levels of spatial specificity:
 - regional
 - continental (aggregations of the above regions)

and three specific emissions categories: 
 - ASGM (artisanal and small-scale gold mines)
 - elemental (ASGM + other elemental mercury emissions)
 - total (elemental + oxidized mercury emissions)

## Gridding the emissions
This inventory is resolved on the regional scale, so gridding of the emissions to finer scales will require the prescription of intra-regional (or intra-continental) emissions distributions. For example, this inventory was gridded for use in the GEOS-Chem atmospheric model using this inventory's continental total Hg emissions and the previously-used inventory's sub-continental spatial distribution of Hg emissions.
